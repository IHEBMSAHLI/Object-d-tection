# Object Detection Project

## Overview

This repository provides resources and code for detecting objects, with a primary focus on car detection. The project leverages both pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and custom approaches to highlight flexibility and adaptability in various detection tasks.

## Project Structure

- **`car-detaction-yolo.ipynb`**: Implements car detection using the YOLO algorithm. This notebook demonstrates a powerful and efficient real-time detection model.
- **`costume-car-detaction.ipynb`**: A custom implementation of car detection tailored for specific datasets or requirements.

## Key Features

- **State-of-the-art Methods**: Uses YOLO for efficient and accurate object detection.
- **Custom Solutions**: Provides flexibility to adapt detection pipelines to unique datasets or challenges.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear code and well-documented steps in Jupyter notebooks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `torch` (for YOLO)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Object-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd Object-Detection
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
